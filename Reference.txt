Here i am going to maintain some good document/url for ansible quick reference.

For all network modules reference document:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_network_modules.html

For quick hands-on on ansible with GNS3 labs:
"Ansible for Network Engineers: Quick Start GNS3 & Ansible" by David Bombal
